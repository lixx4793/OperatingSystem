How to compile:

  $ make
  can be used in command line to make both executables. Alternatively, 
  $ make <name_of_executable>
  will also work but only compiling the specified executable. For example:
  $ make client
  will compile only the client program.
  $ make clean
  will remove the generated executable

How to use the program:

  To run the server program, type the following in the command line:
  $ ./server <DAG FILE> <SERVER PORT>
  where <DAG FILE> is the file that details the structure among voting regions,
  <SERVER PORT> will be this server program's port number once it starts
  to run. Large numbers such 4061 should work as the <SERVER PORT>.
  
  To run the client program, type the following in the command line:
  $ ./client <REQ FILE> <SERVER IP> <SERVER PORT>
  where <REQ FILE> is the file with all the commands to be executed,
  <SERVER IP> is the IP address of the machine on which the server
  program is running, and <SERVER PORT> is the port number of the
  corresponding server program.
  
  For example, if the server program is running on a machine
  with IP 100.10.10.10 after the command:
  $ ./server voting_regions.dag 4061
  then the command to run the client program will be:
  $ ./client input.req 100.10.10.10 4061
  (assuming that voting_regions.dag and input.req are the file names of
  corresponding input files)

Assumptions: As those stated in the PA4 handout.
